  abstract = {In this paper, a system for pitch independent musical instrument recognition is presented. A wide set of features covering both spectral and temporal properties of sounds was investigated, and their extraction algorithms were designed. The usefulness of the features was validated using test data that consisted of 1498 samples covering the full pitch ranges of 30 orchestral instruments from the string, brass and woodwind families, played with different techniques. The correct instrument family was recognized with 94\% accuracy and individual instruments in 80\% of cases. These results are compared to those reported in other work. Also, utilization of a hierarchical classification framework is considered.},

  abstract = {The Bilbao project aimed at relating intrinsic characteristics of the materials (wood density and stiffness) and some geometric characteristics of the violin's constituent part (thicknesses of the plates) with the tonal qualities of the complete violins. To this end, six instruments were carefully built at the Bilbao making school: three instruments with normal backs, each paired with a pliant (thin), normal or resistant (thick) top; similarly, three with normal tops, each paired with a pliant, normal or resistant back. The two examples of normal top paired with normal back serve as a control. Wood for tops and backs were closely matched in density and sound speeds-all tops and backs from the same trees. Greater control was achieved by having all plates and scrolls cut by CNC routers, using the Huberman Stradivari model. The outside surface was not changed as the graduation was performed entirely on the inside surface. In addition, another six instruments were built by six established makers, following a similar procedure but with less constraints on the choice of wood (not the same trees as for the Bilbao set though a similar density was imposed) and on the graduation of the routed plates which was left totally free (but ended in the same range of thicknesses). Finally, another violin built with a very different profile but made by one of the established maker was added to the pool as an outlier. These thirteen violins were then evaluated by twenty players during a free categorisation task and by about 70 listeners (31 violin makers, 26 bow players and 15 others) during a listening test in the Bilbao conservatory auditorium. The tests show very large differences in terms of timbre, playability and volume between the violins, and these differences will be discussed in the light of their construction parameters.},

  abstract = {A statistical pattern-recognition technique was applied to the classification of musical instrument tones within a taxonomic hierarchy. Perceptually salient acoustic features---related to the physical properties of source excitation and resonance structure---were measured from the output of an auditory model (the log-lag correlogram) for 1023 isolated tones over the full pitch ranges of 15 orchestral instruments. The data set included examples from the string (bowed and plucked), woodwind (single, double, and air reed), and brass families. Using 70\%/30\% splits between training and test data, maximum a\hphantom{,}posteriori classifiers were constructed based on Gaussian models arrived at through Fisher multiple-discriminant analysis. The classifiers distinguished transient from continuant tones with approximately 99\% correct performance. Instrument families were identified with approximately 90\% performance, and individual instruments were identified with an overall success rate of approximately 70\%. These preliminary analyses compare favorably with human performance on the same task and demonstrate the utility of the hierarchical approach to classification.},

We extract audio features related to timbre and we exploit feature selection techniques in order to investigate what are the most characterizing ones. We compare different feature selection algorithms and we illustrate how we applied their outcome to a classification task with historical and modern instruments. Results show that the classification performance improves when using the selected features.},

  abstract = {Individual recognition among instruments of the same type is a challenging problem and it has been rarely investigated. In this study, the individual recognition of violins is explored. Based on the source--filter model, the spectrum can be divided into tonal content and nontonal content, which reflects the timbre from complementary aspects. The tonal/nontonal gammatone frequency cepstral coefficients (GFCC) are combined to describe the corresponding spectrum contents in this study. In the recognition system, Gaussian mixture models--universal background model (GMM--UBM) is employed to parameterize the distribution of the combined features. In order to evaluate the recognition task of violin individuals, a solo dataset including 86 violins is developed in this study. Compared with other features, the combined features show a better performance in both individual violin recognition and violin grade classification. Experimental results also show the GMM--UBM outperforms the CNN, especially when the training data are limited. Finally, the effect of players on the individual violin recognition is investigated.},

When the patterns of the two violins were similar, the subjects responded that the timbre of both violins was similar than the other violin whose pattern of peak frequencies was different. The present study discussed the contribution of the similarity of patterns and the difference between patterns to the identification of the timbre.},

More specifically, we aim at finding the correlation between the features extracted from accelerometric measurements of the bridge mobility and from audio recordings of a prescribed set of performances. Results demonstrate that features describing to the global shape of the spectrum are strongly related. On these descriptors we also show the possibility of predicting the features of audio recordings from the vibrational ones. Experimental data are based on a set of 25 modern violins.},

  abstract = {Modelling musical performers' individual playing styles based on audio features is important for music education, music expression analysis and music generation. In violin performance, the perception of playing styles are mainly affected by the characteristic musical timbre, which is mostly determined by performers, instruments and recording conditions. To verify if timbre features can describe a performer's style adequately, we examine a violinist identification method based on note-level timbre feature distributions. We first apply it using solo datasets to recognise professional violinists, then use it to identify master players from commercial concerto recordings. The results show that the designed features and method work very well for both datasets. The identification accuracy with the solo dataset using MFCCs and spectral constrast features are 0.94 and 0.91 respectively. Significantly lower but promising results are reported with the concerto dataset. Results suggest that the selected timbre features can model performers' individual playing reasonably objectively, regardless of the instrument they play.},
