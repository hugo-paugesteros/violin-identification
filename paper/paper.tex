\section{Introduction}\label{s:introduction}
 
Musical instruments classification is a Musical Information Retrieval (MIR) task which consists of determining the instruments present in a recording. This topic has been extensively studied in the literature, and for monophonic recordings (containing only one instrument), state-of-the-art models reach often almost $100\%$. However, few articles have addressed the issue of identifying individual instruments of the same type.

In \cite{zhaoViolinistIdentificationUsing2022}

This paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{s:methodology} presents the methodology of our experiment, describing data collection, features extraction, data exploration and finally classification using machine learning methods. Results of the experiments are discussed in Section \ref{s:results}. Finally, conlusions are drawn in Section \ref*{s:conclusions}, which also outlines possible future developments. 

\section{Methodology}\label{s:methodology}

\subsection{Dataset}

During the Bilbao Project, thirteen violins were built in order to relate their material and geometrical characteristics with their tonal quality \citep{fritzBilbaoProjectSearching2021}. These violins have been played in 2019 by twenty-three professional violinists, each of them having recorded a scale on each violin and a short musical excerpt on a violin of their choice. The recordings were made under the same conditions in a large rehearsal room at the Bilbao conservatory, keeping the distance between the player and the microphone constant. Our dataset thus consists of $13 \times 23$ scales plus $1 \times 23$ musical excerpts.

	\caption{Recording time available with respect to players and with respect to violins}
\end{figure}

Six of those thirteen Bilbao violins (violins number 1, 4, 5, 9, 11 and 13) were brought to the 2024 Villfavard Workshop and were recorded again. They were played freely by four new players in a small room, under rather different conditions than during the 2019 recordings.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Features}

The following features have been compared for the classification task :

\subsubsection{Long Time Average Spectra (LTAS)}{

The Long Time Average Spectra (LTAS) of a recording is obtained by dividing the input signal into overlapping segments, then calculating the windowed DFT of each segment and finally averaging the power of those DFTs :

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		% \usetikzlibrary{arrows,positioning,shapes}
		\tikzstyle{entry} = [draw=none, text width=3em, text centered, minimum height=3em]
		\tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, text width=4em, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=3em]
		\tikzstyle{arrow} = [draw, -latex']
		\node [entry] (signal) {Signal};
		\node [block, right=of signal] (window) {Window};
		\node [block, right=of window] (dft) {DFT};
		\node [block, right=of dft] (power) {$|\cdot|^2$};
		\node [block, right=of power] (average) {Average};
		\node [entry, right=of average] (ltas) {LTAS};

		\path[draw,->] (signal) edge (window);
		\path[draw,->] (window) edge (dft);
		\path[draw,->] (dft) edge (power);
		\path[draw,->] (power) edge (average);
		\path[draw,->] (average) edge (ltas);
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

LTAS has been used in \cite{buenCOMPARINGSOUNDGOLDEN2005} in order to compare the tonal quality of violins. More specifically, the sound of old Italians violins (Stradivari/Guarneri) and modern violins has been compared. The author concludes that differences between these two groups can be shown using LTAS

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../figures/ltas.png}
	\caption{Standard Deviation of the LTAS of the 13 violins with respect to players}
\end{figure}
}

\subsubsection{Mel-Frenquency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)}{
	MFCCs are obtained by mapping the frequencies of a spectrum onto a nonlinear mel-scale (a perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance from one another), taking the log, and then compute the DCT of the result. Here, instead of calculating the MFCCs on overlapping segments, we use a LTAS as our spectra as we want features with a long-term meaning :

	\begin{figure}[!h]
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			% \usetikzlibrary{arrows,positioning,shapes}
			\tikzstyle{entry} = [draw=none, text width=3em, text centered, minimum height=3em]
			\tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, text width=3em, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=3em]
			\tikzstyle{arrow} = [draw, -latex']
			
			\node [entry] (signal) {Signal};
			\node [block, right=of signal] (ltas) {LTAS};
			\node [block, right=of ltas] (mel) {Mel \\ Filter};
			\node [block, right=of mel] (log) {Log};
			\node [block, right=of log] (dct) {DCT};
			\node [entry, right=of dct] (mfcc) {MFCC};

			\path[draw,->] (signal) edge (ltas);
			\path[draw,->] (ltas) edge (mel);
			\path[draw,->] (mel) edge (log);
			\path[draw,->] (log) edge (dct);
			\path[draw,->] (dct) edge (mfcc);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{figure}

	MFCC are a set of features that has been extensively used for Automatic Speaker Recognition and for Instruments Classification.

		\caption{Standard Deviation of the LTAS of the 13 violins with respect to players}
	\end{figure}
}

\subsubsection{Long-Term Cepstral Coefficients (LTCC)}{
	LTCC have been introduced in \cite{lukasikLongTermCepstral2010b} for Indivudial Instrument Identification. Their calculation is similar to that of MFCCs, except that a Mel-filterbank is not applied and that the final step is given by an Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform.

		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\tikzstyle{entry} = [draw=none, text width=3em, text centered, minimum height=3em]
			\tikzstyle{block} = [rectangle, draw, text width=3em, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=3em]
			\tikzstyle{arrow} = [draw, -latex']
			\node [entry] (signal) {Signal};
			\node [block, right=of signal] (ltas) {LTAS};
			\node [block, right=of ltas] (log) {Log};
			\node [block, right=of log] (idft) {iDFT};
			\node [entry, right=of idft] (ltcc) {LTCC};

			\path[draw,->] (signal) edge (ltas);
			\path[draw,->] (ltas) edge (log);
			\path[draw,->] (log) edge (idft);
			\path[draw,->] (idft) edge (ltcc);
		\end{tikzpicture}
