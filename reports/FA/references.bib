  abstract = {In this paper, a study on the classification of violin and viola instrument sounds in the same notes that are hard for people to distinguish is presented. First, 16 statistical features defined in the time and frequency domain for 512 violin note recordings and 512 viola note recordings are extracted. Classification algorithms including Linear Distinction Analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) classifiers are used to recognize violin and viola instrument sounds. The classification operation is performed on three different sets of features: only time domain features (12), only frequency domain features (4), and both time domain and frequency domain features (16). Simulation results show that the highest accuracy rate is obtained when using the Random Forests classifier with both time and frequency domain attributes. With Random Forest classifier, while obtaining 64.4\% classification accuracy with 10 times cross-validity using only time domain and only frequency domain features, 79.6\% classification success is achieved with both time and frequency domain features.},

A large sound database is collected from excerpts of musical phrases acquired from commercial recordings translating different instrument instances, performers, and recording conditions. More than 150 signal processing features are studied including new descriptors. Two feature selection techniques, inertia ratio maximization with feature space projection and genetic algorithms are considered in a class pairwise manner whereby the most relevant features are fetched for each instrument pair. For the classification task, experimental results are provided using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and support vector machines (SVMs). It is shown that higher recognition rates can be reached with pairwise optimized subsets of features in association with SVM classification using a radial basis function kernel.},

Finally, another violin built with a very different profile but made by one of the established maker was added to the pool as an outlier. These thirteen violins were then evaluated by twenty players during a free categorisation task and by about 70 listeners (31 violin makers, 26 bow players and 15 others) during a listening test in the Bilbao conservatory auditorium. The tests show very large differences in terms of timbre, playability and volume between the violins, and these differences will be discussed in the light of their construction parameters.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The automatic assessment of music performance has become an area of increasing interest due to the growing number of technology-enhanced music learning systems. In most of these systems, the assessment of musical performance is based on pitch and onset accuracy, but very few pay attention to other important aspects of performance, such as sound quality or timbre. This is particularly true in violin education, where the quality of timbre plays a significant role in the assessment of musical performances. However, obtaining quantifiable criteria for the assessment of timbre quality is challenging, as it relies on consensus among the subjective interpretations of experts. We present an approach to assess the quality of timbre in violin performances using machine learning techniques. We collected audio recordings of several tone qualities and performed perceptual tests to find correlations among different timbre dimensions. We processed the audio recordings to extract acoustic features for training tone-quality models. Correlations among the extracted features were analyzed and feature information for discriminating different timbre qualities were investigated. A real-time feedback system designed for pedagogical use was implemented in which users can train their own timbre models to assess and receive feedback on their performances.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Audio Spectrum Basis captures the statistically most regular features of the sound feature space thus it has been expected to well characterize instruments. The results confirmed the expectations. Since violinmakers follow the same ideal model of instrument construction and use similar material for their creation, differences of their sound are tiny, Audio Spectrum Basis enabled discrimination of several instruments as more dissimilar then the others.

Successful instrument recognition techniques in solos (monophonic or polyphonic recordings of single instruments) can help to deal with this task. We introduce an instrument recognition process in solo recordings of a set of instruments (bassoon, clarinet, flute, guitar, piano, cello and violin), which yields a high recognition rate. A large and very diverse solo database (108 different solos, all by different performers) is used in order to encompass the different sound possibilities of each instrument and evaluate the generalization abilities of the classification process. First we bring classification results using a very extensive collection of features (62 different feature types), and then use our GDE feature selection algorithm to select a smaller feature set with a relatively short computation time, which allows us to perform instrument recognition in solos in real-time, with only a slight decrease in recognition rate. We demonstrate that our real-time solo classifier can also be useful for instrument recognition in duet performances, and improved using simple ?source reduction?.},

Furthermore, i t shows that the spectrum level of all strings a r e approximately equal to 12 Bark and thereafter it drops 4 dB from a string to the next lower and that the high frequency limit of each string drops one Bark from one string to the next lower string.

Our investigations on ASVspoof 2015 challenge database and AVspoof database show that, when compared to the approaches based on conventional short-term spectral features, the proposed approach with a linear discriminative classifier yields a better system, irrespective of whether the spoofed signal is replayed to the microphone or is directly injected into the system software process.

  abstract = {The violins of Stradivari are recognized worldwide as an excellence in craftsmanship, a model for instrument makers, and an unachievable desire for collectors and players. However, despite the myth surrounding these instruments, blindfolded players tendentially prefer to play modern violins. Here, we present a double blind listening experiment aimed at analyzing and comparatively rating the sound timbre of violins. The mythic instruments were listened to among other well regarded and not so well regarded violins. 70 listeners (violin makers of the Cremona area) rated the timbre difference between the simple musical scales played on a test and a reference violin, and the results showed that their preference converged on one particular Stradivari. The acoustical measurements revealed some similarities between the subjective ratings and the physical characteristics of the violins. It is speculated that the myth of Stradivari could have been boosted, among other factors, by the specimens of tonal superior quality, which biased favourably the judgment on his instruments and spread on all of the maker's production. These results contribute to the understanding of the timbre of violins and suggest the characteristics that are in a relationship with the pleasantness of the timbre.},

The purpose of this study is to understand what are these properties, by means of feature-based analysis. We extract audio features related to timbre and we exploit feature selection techniques in order to investigate what are the most characterizing ones. We compare different feature selection algorithms and we illustrate how we applied their outcome to a classification task with historical and modern instruments. Results show that the classification performance improves when using the selected features.},

A methodology with feature extraction and evaluation is proposed and assessed with a number of experiments, whose final stage is to detect instruments in solo passages. In feature selection it is found that similar but different rankings for individual tone classification and solo passage instrument recognition are reported. Based on the feature selection results, excerpts from concerto and sonata files are processed, so as to detect and distinguish four major instruments in solo passages: trumpet, flute, violin, and piano. Nineteen features selected from the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and the MPEG-7 audio descriptors achieve a recognition rate of around 94\% by the best classifier assessed by cross validation.},

Based on the source--filter model, the spectrum can be divided into tonal content and nontonal content, which reflects the timbre from complementary aspects. The tonal/nontonal gammatone frequency cepstral coefficients (GFCC) are combined to describe the corresponding spectrum contents in this study. In the recognition system, Gaussian mixture models--universal background model (GMM--UBM) is employed to parameterize the distribution of the combined features. In order to evaluate the recognition task of violin individuals, a solo dataset including 86 violins is developed in this study. Compared with other features, the combined features show a better performance in both individual violin recognition and violin grade classification. Experimental results also show the GMM--UBM outperforms the CNN, especially when the training data are limited. Finally, the effect of players on the individual violin recognition is investigated.},

The estimated value of sound quality evaluation is consistent with expert judgements for 75.5\% of instruments from AMATI multimedia database containing recordings of violins from 10th International Henryk Wieniawski Violin Maker Competition.},

Questionnaires were used to examine the distinction in violin timbre by the difference in the patterns of peak frequencies. When the patterns of the two violins were similar, the subjects responded that the timbre of both violins was similar than the other violin whose pattern of peak frequencies was different. The present study discussed the contribution of the similarity of patterns and the difference between patterns to the identification of the timbre.},

With respect to previous publications on this topic, we tackle the problem using a feature-based approach. More specifically, we aim at finding the correlation between the features extracted from accelerometric measurements of the bridge mobility and from audio recordings of a prescribed set of performances. Results demonstrate that features describing to the global shape of the spectrum are strongly related. On these descriptors we also show the possibility of predicting the features of audio recordings from the vibrational ones. Experimental data are based on a set of 25 modern violins.},

In violin performance, the perception of playing styles are mainly affected by the characteristic musical timbre, which is mostly determined by performers, instruments and recording conditions. To verify if timbre features can describe a performer's style adequately, we examine a violinist identification method based on note-level timbre feature distributions. We first apply it using solo datasets to recognise professional violinists, then use it to identify master players from commercial concerto recordings. The results show that the designed features and method work very well for both datasets. The identification accuracy with the solo dataset using MFCCs and spectral constrast features are 0.94 and 0.91 respectively. Significantly lower but promising results are reported with the concerto dataset. Results suggest that the selected timbre features can model performers' individual playing reasonably objectively, regardless of the instrument they play.},
